## Problem description
Backing up a car can sometimes be a stressful experience.
When you have something attached to your car, it gets even more nerve-racking.
The problem is that the motion control while moving forward is stable, while reversing the motion is unstable.

## Instructions
To run the simulation script, run `main.m` on MATLAB or Octave (although it may not have some of the required functions; it has not been tested).
