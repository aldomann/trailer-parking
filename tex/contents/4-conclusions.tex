\section{Conclusions}

In the previous sections we have three different approaches to implement a controller to aid the driver in the process of parking with a trailer attached to their car:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State space control (using MATLAB).
    \item Optimisation-based control (using C).
    \item Steering-based control (using Python).
\end{itemize}

Except the optimisation-based control, we showed that all of the models are viable options for control with their own advantages and disadvantages.

\bigskip
We think that as an improvement and further development of our work it would be interesting to test our results. We could consider a simulation or even a real miniature car with a trailer using LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT (or similar) using MATLAB's Simulink or Python's \inline{nxt-python} library.
