\begin{abstract}
	The interesting aspect of car-trailer system is that the motion control while moving forward is stable, while reversing the motion is unstable. In this report the system is studied to analyse its stability and how to control it. Based on Classical Control Theory a first model is constructed using linear controller design (programmed in MATLAB). A second model is optimisation-based control (programmed in C). Last but not least, a model is constructed using steering-based control (programmed in Python). It is shown that two of the methods are viable options for control with their own advantages and disadvantages.
